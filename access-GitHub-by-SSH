Yes, you can absolutely use SSH instead of a Git credential manager to push changes to GitHub from your Raspberry Pi. Here's a step-by-step guide:

---

### **1. Generate an SSH Key**
On your Raspberry Pi terminal, generate an SSH key pair:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
- If `ed25519` is unsupported, you can use `rsa`: 
  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
  ```
- When prompted:
  - Press **Enter** to accept the default file location (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`).
  - Set a passphrase or leave it empty.

---

### **2. Add Your SSH Key to GitHub**
1. Display the public key:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```
2. Copy the entire output.

3. Go to GitHub:
   - Navigate to **Settings > SSH and GPG keys**.
   - Click **New SSH key**.
   - Paste the public key and give it a title.
   - Save the key.

---

### **3. Configure Git to Use SSH**
Ensure Git is set to use SSH instead of HTTPS:
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repository.git
```
Replace `username/repository` with your actual GitHub username and repo name.

---

### **4. Test the SSH Connection**
Run this command to verify the SSH setup:
```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```
If everything is configured correctly, you'll see:
```
Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

---

### **5. Push Changes**
Now you can push changes as usual:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main
```

That's it! Let me know if you run into any issues.
